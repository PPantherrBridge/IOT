                        The Year of Desolation
                    </h2>
                    
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The world, in the year 2050, had become a graveyard of human ambition. What was once called Earth—vibrant, teeming with life—now stood as a monument to humanity's hubris and nature's merciless retribution. The skies hung perpetually gray, choked with the ash of burned forests and the dust of crumbled cities. Rivers ran black with industrial poison. The oceans, once the cradle of life, had become acidic tombs where nothing could survive.</p>

                        <p>Against this apocalyptic backdrop lived Mikael Engel, a young man of twenty-two years whose eyes still held the dangerous gleam of hope. He attended the Central College for Environmental Studies, one of the few institutions still functioning in the dying world, where he poured over texts and research with an almost religious fervor. His singular obsession: to understand what had gone wrong, and perhaps—impossibly—to reverse it.</p>

                        <p>It was in the sterile, fluorescent-lit halls of this college that he first encountered Georgia. She stood at the front of the ecology seminar, presenting her research on soil regeneration with such passion that Mikael found himself mesmerized not by her data, but by the fierce intelligence burning in her eyes. When she spoke of saving the Earth, she didn't sound naive—she sounded like a warrior preparing for battle.</p>

                        <p>Their romance began as all great loves do: with a shared dream too large for one person to carry alone. Late nights in the library became their dates, spreadsheets of carbon calculations their love letters. In Georgia's presence, Mikael felt the weight of the dying world lift just enough for him to breathe.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Do you really think we can do it?"</span> Georgia asked him one evening, as they sat on the roof of the science building, watching the sickly sunset paint the polluted sky in shades of toxic orange. <span class="dialogue">"Save the world, I mean. Or are we just... pretending?"</span></p>

                        <p>Mikael took her hand, feeling the warmth of her skin against his. <span class="dialogue">"I think,"</span> he said slowly, <span class="dialogue">"that if we're going to die on this planet, we might as well die trying."</span></p>

                        <p>She leaned her head on his shoulder, and for a moment, the world didn't seem quite so broken.</p>

                        <p>His mother, Frieda Engel, loved Georgia immediately. In their small apartment where Frieda had raised Mikael alone through poverty and hardship, Georgia was welcomed like the daughter she'd never had. Frieda worked tirelessly—cleaning offices, serving food, mending clothes—barely scraping by, but she never complained. She only wanted to see her son happy.</p>

                        <p>But fate, as it often does, had other plans.</p>

                        The Announcement
                    </h2>
                    
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The broadcast came on a Tuesday morning, though Mikael would later struggle to remember the exact date—a peculiarity of his mind that would prove more significant than anyone could have imagined. The Global Space Organization, the entity that had quietly been terraforming Mars for the past decade, made their announcement with the clinical efficiency of surgeons delivering a terminal diagnosis.</p>

                        <p><span class="emphasis">The Great Martian Migration Mission</span>—GMMM, they called it with bureaucratic efficiency—was ready to commence. Mars, they declared, was habitable. Humanity had a lifeboat. But not everyone could board.</p>

                        <p>The requirements scrolled across every screen: university degrees in essential fields, professional certifications, proven employment records. And for those who lacked these credentials, there was one final option—wealth. The price of passage ranged from 45 to 85 million rupees per person.</p>

                        <p>Mikael listened in the college commons, surrounded by his fellow students. Around him, some cheered—the privileged few whose futures had just been secured. Others wept—those who knew they would be left behind. But Mikael simply stood frozen, the numbers echoing in his mind like a death sentence.</p>

                        <p>He thought of his mother, who had raised him alone, working herself to exhaustion. They could barely afford his tuition. Eighty-five million rupees might as well have been infinity. And he didn't even have a degree yet—he was still a student.</p>

                        <p>Georgia found him hours later, still sitting in the commons long after everyone else had left. She knelt before him, taking his hands in hers.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"I'll talk to them,"</span> she said firmly. <span class="dialogue">"My parents. They have money, Mikael. They can afford—"</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"For me and my mother?"</span> Mikael interrupted, his voice hollow. <span class="dialogue">"That's over one hundred fifty million, Georgia. No one has that kind of—"</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"My father is a neural surgeon. My mother is an archaeologist who's consulted for the Mars expedition. They're connected, they're wealthy, and they love me. If I tell them about us, if I explain how much you mean to me—"</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"If you tell them about us,"</span> Mikael said softly, <span class="dialogue">"they'll tell you to leave me behind."</span></p>

                        <p>Georgia's eyes flashed with defiance. <span class="dialogue">"Then they don't know me at all."</span></p>

                        The Dinner
                    </h2>
                    
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The invitation came within days. Georgia had told her parents about Mikael, and Dr. Adrian Engel and Professor Helena Engel wished to meet this young man who had captured their daughter's heart.</p>

                        <p>Mikael borrowed a suit, spent an hour trying to tame his unruly hair, and took three buses to reach the Engel estate. The house was magnificent—pre-collapse architecture with gardens that were somehow still green. Private water filtration, he realized. Wealth could buy miracles.</p>

                        <p>Georgia answered the door, stunning in a simple blue dress. She squeezed his hand reassuringly before leading him to the dining room where her parents waited.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Adrian stood as they entered—tall, steel-gray hair, eyes that assessed Mikael with surgical precision. Professor Helena sat with perfect posture, examining Mikael as though he were an artifact to be catalogued.</p>

                        <p>The dinner began pleasantly enough. But as the main course was served, Dr. Adrian set down his fork with deliberate precision.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"So, Mikael,"</span> he began, his voice carrying weight, <span class="dialogue">"tell me about your family. Your lineage. Your background."</span></p>

                        <p>Mikael felt Georgia tense beside him. <span class="dialogue">"My mother works in service industries,"</span> he said carefully. <span class="dialogue">"I was raised by her alone."</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Service industries,"</span> Dr. Adrian repeated, as though diagnosing a disease. <span class="dialogue">"I see. And your education—you're still a student, correct? No degree as of yet?"</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"I'm completing my environmental studies program—"</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Which will be worthless,"</span> Dr. Adrian interrupted, <span class="dialogue">"on a planet that's already dead."</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Father—"</span> Georgia began, but her father raised a hand.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"My daughter is extraordinary,"</span> he continued, each word precisely enunciated. <span class="dialogue">"She has a place on Mars secured through merit. She will be part of humanity's future. You, on the other hand, are a boy from poverty with no prospects, no degree, no connections, and no future. And you have the audacity to make my daughter love you, knowing you cannot follow where she must go."</span></p>

                        <p>The room fell silent. Mikael felt as though he'd been struck.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"You think you love her?"</span> Dr. Adrian continued relentlessly. <span class="dialogue">"You cannot even afford passage to Mars. You certainly cannot afford to love a woman so far above your station that you could never, in your wildest dreams, hope to deserve her."</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Get out,"</span> Georgia said, her voice shaking with fury. She stood, throwing her napkin on the table. <span class="dialogue">"Father, how dare you—"</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Georgia, sit down,"</span> her mother said sharply.</p>

                        <p>But Mikael was already standing. He looked at Georgia one last time—the tears streaming down her cheeks, the anger and helplessness in her eyes—and then he turned and walked out.</p>

                        <p>He heard Georgia crying behind him. He heard her father's cold voice: <span class="dialogue">"You will not see him again. We leave for Mars soon. You will forget this distraction."</span></p>

                        <p>Mikael didn't cry until he was alone in his room, where no one could hear him break.</p>

                        <span class="chapter-number">CHAPTER IV</span>
                        The Disorder
                    </h2>
                    
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Depression descended upon Mikael like a physical weight. Days blurred together—or perhaps they didn't blur, but rather ceased to have meaning. He stopped attending lectures. He stopped answering his mother's worried questions. He stopped measuring time in any meaningful way.</p>

                        <p>It was Frieda who finally dragged him to Dr. Raymond Castellanos, a psychiatrist who still practiced despite the world's collapse. During the sessions, while discussing his depression and loss, Dr. Castellanos noticed something peculiar.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"When did you last see Georgia?"</span> the doctor asked.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Two days ago,"</span> Mikael answered.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"What day was that?"</span></p>

                        <p>Mikael opened his mouth, then stopped. He frowned. <span class="dialogue">"I... Wednesday? Or was it..."</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"What day is today, Mikael?"</span></p>

                        <p>The question hung in the air. Mikael looked at the calendar on the wall, but the numbers meant nothing. <span class="dialogue">"I... I don't know."</span></p>

                        <p>Over the next hour, Dr. Castellanos conducted tests. Mikael could remember events with perfect clarity—what Georgia wore, what they discussed. But he couldn't place any of it on a timeline. He knew things happened "recently" or "a while ago," but actual dates, days of the week—they slipped through his mind like water.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"You have,"</span> Dr. Castellanos said finally, his voice gentle, <span class="dialogue">"an extremely rare condition called Chronological Dissociation Disorder. Your brain cannot properly anchor memories to specific points in time."</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Can it be fixed?"</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"We don't know enough about it. It appears to be neurological, possibly congenital. You've likely had this your entire life, Mikael. You've just developed coping mechanisms—relying on others to remind you of dates, following routines instead of calendars."</span></p>

                        <p>The words echoed in Mikael's mind. He thought of all the times his mother had reminded him of dates, how he'd relied on classmates to tell him when exams were scheduled. A disorder. A broken piece of his mind that couldn't grasp something as fundamental as <span class="emphasis">when</span>.</p>

                        <p>Little did he know, this disorder would become the most crucial element of his entire existence.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Despite his depression, despite her parents' commands, Mikael had to see Georgia one more time. He went to their spot in Central Park—the bench by the fountain where they'd confessed their feelings.</p>

                        <p>She was there, as though she'd known he would come. Her eyes were red from crying, and when she saw him, she ran into his arms.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"I hate them,"</span> she whispered. <span class="dialogue">"I told them I won't go without you, but they won't listen."</span></p>

                        <p>They were interrupted by the sound of a car door. Dr. Adrian and Professor Helena strode across the park toward them.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Georgia, get in the car,"</span> Dr. Adrian commanded.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"No."</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"We leave for the launch facility tomorrow. Your bags are packed."</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Tomorrow?"</span> Georgia's voice broke. <span class="dialogue">"But you said I had time—"</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"We moved up our departure to prevent exactly this,"</span> Professor Helena said coldly.</p>

                        <p>Georgia's mother grabbed her arm, pulling her toward the car. Georgia struggled, reaching back.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"I love you,"</span> Mikael called out as they dragged her away. <span class="dialogue">"Georgia, I love you!"</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"I love you too!"</span> she cried back. <span class="dialogue">"I'll find a way back, I promise!"</span></p>

                        <p>The car door slammed. Through the window, he could see her pressing her palm against the glass. He pressed his hand from the outside, separated by inches that might as well have been the distance to Mars.</p>

                        <p>Then the car drove away, and she was gone.</p>

                        <p>The next day, Mikael stood at the Space Station observation deck with thousands of others who couldn't afford to leave. He scanned the crowds until he saw her—Georgia in line with her parents, her luggage being checked. Even from this distance, he could see the devastation on her face.</p>

                        <p>She looked up at the observation deck. Though she couldn't possibly pick him out, he raised his hand. She raised hers too, pressing it against her heart.</p>

                        <p>The ships launched one by one, engines roaring, flames scorching the earth. Mikael watched until the last ship became a speck against the gray sky.</p>

                        <p>Georgia was gone. And Mikael went home and didn't leave his room for weeks.</p>

                        <p>Then came the day he was studying in his apartment, the radio playing softly. A news bulletin interrupted the music.</p>

                        <p class="dialogue">"We interrupt with breaking news from Mars. Colonial authorities have confirmed the first murder in human history on the red planet.

                        <p class="dialogue">"The discovery was made when residents began reporting discolored, foul-smelling water.

                        <p>The room spun. Mikael gripped his desk.</p>

                        <p class="dialogue">"Georgia Engel had been missing for three days. She was the daughter of Dr. Adrian Engel and Professor Helena Engel. This marks the first violent crime in Mars colonial history..."</p>

                        <p>Georgia. Dead. Murdered. Her body in a water tank, her blood flowing through Martian pipes, discovered only because people complained about the taste.</p>

                        <p>When awareness returned, he was on the floor, and his mother was holding him, rocking him as he screamed his grief.</p>

                        <p>That night, Mikael contemplated ending his life. Only Frieda's presence stopped him. He couldn't do that to her.</p>

                        <p>Then his phone buzzed. The family doctor. Frieda had been admitted to the hospital. An emergency.</p>

                        <p>He ran. Three buses felt like eternity. When he reached the ward, the doctor's face told him everything.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"I'm sorry, Mikael,"</span> Dr. Patel said gently. <span class="dialogue">"Your mother had a degenerative eye disease. Untreated for years—she never mentioned symptoms, never came for checkups. By the time the pain became unbearable..."</span></p>

                        <p>Mikael pushed past into the room. His mother lay still on the bed. When he took her hand, it was already cool.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"She passed about an hour ago. There was nothing we could do. I'm so sorry."</span></p>

                        <p>Mikael sank into the chair, still holding her hand. Frieda. Who had worked herself to exhaustion to give him an education. Who had never complained, never shown weakness. Who had been strong for him through everything, and died alone because she didn't want to burden him.</p>

                        <p>He sat for hours as her hand grew cold, as light faded outside, as the world spun without her.</p>

                        <p>Everyone he loved was gone. Georgia, murdered on Mars. Frieda, dead from a preventable disease. And Mikael, alone on a dying planet with nothing left.</p>

                        <p>That night, he prepared to end everything. He had the pills. The note written. Nothing left to live for.</p>

                        <p>But then he fell asleep, and in his dreams, something extraordinary happened.</p>

                        <p>Georgia spoke, her voice echoing strangely: <span class="dialogue">"You can still save us, Mikael."</span></p>

                        <p>Frieda nodded, taking his hand. <span class="dialogue">"Live and save us. Get up. Wake up."</span></p>

                        <p>Together, their voices harmonized: <span class="dialogue">"TRAVEL BACK TO US!"</span></p>

                        <p>Mikael woke with a gasp. Travel back. Travel... <span class="emphasis">back</span>.</p>

                        <p>Not "come back" in death. Not "remember" in grief. But travel back. Through time. To when they were still alive. To when he could save them.</p>

                        <p>The next morning, Mikael withdrew from environmental studies and applied to the physics department, quantum mechanics track.</p>

                        <p>When asked why, he looked the advisor in the eye and said: <span class="dialogue">"Because I'm going to make time travel possible."</span></p>

                        <p>The advisor laughed. Mikael didn't.</p>

                        <p>For the next six years, Mikael existed in pure, focused obsession. He had no natural talent for physics, but what he lacked in ability, he made up for with desperation. Eighteen hours a day. Skipped meals. Forgotten sleep.</p>

                        <p>The secret was his disorder. What had been a handicap became an asset. While other physicists struggled to conceptualize time as anything but linear progression, Mikael's brain naturally perceived it as fluid. Past, present, and future didn't exist on a neat timeline—they were interconnected in ways he could sense intuitively.</p>

                        <p>By year's end, he'd caught up. By the second, he'd surpassed his peers. By the third, he was publishing papers that made professors reconsider their assumptions.</p>

                        <p>Six years became nine for his master's. Nine became fifteen for his PhD with a dissertation that left committee members in tears—not because it was wrong, but because it was right, and the implications terrified them.</p>

                        <p>At thirty-seven, Dr. Mikael Engel became the youngest appointed to the Global Space Organization's research division.</p>

                        <p>They assigned him to Mars.</p>

                        <p>As Mikael worked on Mars, strange dreams began. Vivid, recurring visions unlike anything before.</p>

                        <p>He saw a figure in purple armor, standing in a massive spaceship's command deck, watching stars drift by. Sometimes alone. Sometimes commanding vast armies. The figure moved through violent conquests without joy or triumph—like someone completing a terrible, necessary task.</p>

                        <p>The strangest part: the figure seemed aware of Mikael. He would occasionally turn and look directly at where Mikael's consciousness floated, and a small, sad smile would cross his face.</p>

                        <p>Mikael mentioned these dreams to no one. His colleagues already thought him eccentric for his time travel obsession.</p>

                        <p>But slowly, terribly, Mikael began recognizing something in the figure's posture, movements, the tilt of his head. The purple-armored figure moved the way Mikael moved. Thought the way Mikael thought. Had the same unconscious gestures.</p>

                        <p>It was impossible. Yet undeniable.</p>

                        <p>Mikael pushed the thoughts away and focused on his work. He had a time machine to build.</p>

                        <p>On his first day, Mikael presented his proposal to the assembled scientists: to build a functioning time machine.</p>

                        <p>The room erupted in laughter.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"The Time Maniac!"</span> someone called.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Did they seriously assign us a crackpot?"</span> another whispered.</p>

                        <p>Over following weeks, he acquired mocking nicknames: The T Guy, Time Weirdo, Doctor Impossible. Jokes about bringing yesterday's coffee, tomorrow's lottery numbers. Constant, casual ridicule.</p>

                        <p>Mikael endured in silence. Revolutionary ideas always faced mockery. He requested a private laboratory away from the main areas. The director probably thought it would keep the "crazy time machine guy" away from serious scientists.</p>

                        <p>Perfect. That was exactly what Mikael wanted.</p>

                        <p>For the next twenty years, Mikael disappeared into his lab. He emerged only for mandatory meetings. His colleagues assumed he was wasting time and resources.</p>

                        <p>They had no idea he was succeeding.</p>

                        <p>Year by year, piece by piece, he assembled his temporal displacement device. The mathematics worked. The experiments proved the theories. The impossible was becoming possible.</p>

                        <p>And still, the purple-armored figure haunted his dreams.</p>

                        <p>Twenty years after arriving on Mars, Dr. Mikael Engel—now fifty-seven, hair completely gray, hands trembling with age and exhaustion—activated his time machine for the first time.</p>

                        <p>It wasn't a massive apparatus. It was elegant: a metallic box the size of a briefcase, connected via quantum entanglement to a wristwatch-like device.</p>

                        <p>When he successfully sent a test particle backward thirty seconds and observed it coexisting with its past self, he wept. Twenty years of mockery, isolation, relentless work—and it had all been worth it.</p>

                        <p>The Global Space Organization, confronted with proof, had no choice but to acknowledge his achievement. Awards followed. Accolades. Recognition. The mockers fell silent.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Mikael Engel stood before the assembled scientific community and accepted their highest honor with a simple speech:</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Twenty years ago, you laughed. But I didn't build this for recognition. I built it for love. And now I'm going to use it."</span></p>

                        <p>He returned to his laboratory, locked the door, and prepared to travel back in time.</p>

                    </h2>
                    
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Mikael set the coordinates with trembling hands. He wanted to return to when he'd met Georgia, to love her properly from the beginning, to prevent the separation that led to her death.</p>

                        <p>But his chronological disorder betrayed him. He couldn't remember the exact date. He knew approximately when, but the specific date didn't exist in his mind the way it existed for normal people.</p>

                        <p>So he estimated. He input a range that should place him in the correct period.</p>

                        <p>The machine activated. Reality twisted. Mikael felt himself pulled apart and reassembled at the quantum level, consciousness streaming backwards through time.</p>

                        <p>When the world solidified, he was young—twenty-two, his body restored. He stood on a familiar street corner, but something was wrong. The buildings looked older. The cars were earlier models. The advertisements promoted products he'd never heard of.</p>

                        <p>He'd miscalculated. But then he saw her. A young woman with Georgia's face, walking with books clutched to her chest.</p>

                        <p>He approached. They talked. She studied environmental science. She shared his passion for saving the world. She was brilliant, funny, kind—everything Georgia had been.</p>

                        <p>Her name, she told him, was Georgia.</p>

                        <p>Overwhelmed with joy at this seeming miracle, Mikael didn't question it. He courted her. They fell in love. It felt right, felt like destiny.</p>

                        <p>They married young. Georgia became pregnant with twins. Mikael was deliriously happy, convinced he'd successfully changed the timeline.</p>

                        <p>The day of birth, Mikael entered the hospital room with flowers. The doctor congratulated him on his twin son and daughter.</p>

                        <p>But when Mikael entered, horror froze him. In the corner, a young nurse held the newborns. Her name tag read: <span class="emphasis">Frieda</span>.</p>

                        <p>Georgia, pale in the bed, smiled weakly. <span class="dialogue">"I named them Mikael and Georgia Engel. Like us. So they'll always have each other."</span></p>

                        <p>Mikael saw the calendar on the wall. The date. The year.</p>

                        <p>His disorder had catastrophically betrayed him. He hadn't gone back to when he'd met his girlfriend Georgia. He'd gone back an entire generation. He'd met, courted, and married <span class="emphasis">his own mother</span>.</p>

                        <p>The baby boy nurse Frieda held was himself. The baby girl was the child who would grow up to become his girlfriend Georgia—his <span class="emphasis">sister</span>.</p>

                        <p>He was his own father. He had created a closed timeloop paradox.</p>

                        <p>Georgia senior died in childbirth moments later. Frieda took baby Mikael to raise as her own, adopting him from the hospital when no father could be found and the hospital couldn't locate family. Baby Georgia was sent to an orphanage, eventually adopted by a wealthy family named Engel—Dr. Adrian and Professor Helena.</p>

                        <p>The loop was complete and horrifying.</p>

                        <p>Mikael ran from the hospital, his mind fracturing. He ran until he collapsed in an alley, screaming at the sky.</p>

                        <p>Then a voice interrupted: <span class="dialogue">"Sir? Mikael? You need to wake up. Your coffee is here."</span></p>

                        <p>Mikael jerked awake at his desk in the Mars laboratory, his assistant standing over him with coffee.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"You fell asleep at your desk again. Are you alright? You were making distressing sounds."</span></p>

                        <p>A dream. It had all been a dream—the time travel, the terrible mistake, the paradox. None of it had happened.</p>

                        <p>Yet.</p>

                        <p>But the dream had been so vivid, so real. Mikael understood with terrible clarity exactly what would happen if he used his time machine without knowing precise dates. His disorder would doom him to repeat exactly what he'd dreamed.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Mikael stared at the time machine on his desk. Then he looked at the research he'd been compiling on the purple-armored figure from his dreams.</p>

                        <p>Kaelim. A name that would become legendary. A refugee from Earth who'd stolen ships and technology, gathered followers, built an empire in space, became a tyrant out of necessity rather than malice.</p>

                        <p>Kaelim, whose life history matched exactly the sequence that would occur if Mikael traveled back, created the paradox, and then—horrified by what he'd done—fled into space to escape the nightmare.</p>

                        <p>The dreams weren't dreams. They were <span class="emphasis">memories</span>. Memories from his future self—from Kaelim—leaking backward through time to warn him.</p>

                        <p>Mikael understood the terrible truth: if he used the time machine, he would become Kaelim. The loop would close. The paradox would become reality.</p>

                        <p>But if he didn't use it, Georgia and Frieda would stay dead, and his life's work would be meaningless.</p>

                        <p class="thought">What should I do?</p>

                        <p>Before he could decide, new orders came. The GSO was reassigning him. They needed his expertise for a project—not on Mars, but back on Earth. A classified facility in the Nevada desert.</p>

                        <p>Area 51.</p>

                        <p>And there, Mikael would discover the truth that explained everything—why Earth was really dying, and what role he was destined to play in humanity's fate.</p>

                    </h2>
                    
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The reassignment came with shocking context. The GSO director called Mikael into a secured briefing room on Mars, where a small group of high-clearance scientists had gathered.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Dr. Engel,"</span> the director began, <span class="dialogue">"what we're about to show you is classified at the highest level. The reason we moved so many governmental operations to Mars wasn't just because Earth was dying."</span></p>

                        <p>A holographic display activated, showing a massive organic structure.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"This is The Stem. We discovered it here on Mars fifteen years ago during deep excavation. It's a biological organism that runs through the entire planet's core—a primordial life-giving structure older than any known life form."</span></p>

                        <p>Mikael stared at the image. The Stem pulsed with bioluminescent energy, a network of organic conduits spreading through Mars's interior like a planetary nervous system.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"We've been studying it intensively,"</span> another scientist continued. <span class="dialogue">"The Stem isn't just dormant biology—it's actively maintaining Mars's new atmosphere. Our terraforming didn't work nearly as well as we claimed. The Stem is doing most of the heavy lifting."</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"But here's what you need to know,"</span> the director said gravely. <span class="dialogue">"Earth had one too."</span></p>

                        <p>The hologram shifted, showing Earth's interior with a similar structure—except this one was broken, severed in two places.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"In 2047, at a facility called Area 51, we were studying Earth's Stem. A maintenance worker named Daryl Harrens had an accident. He fell into the exposed section. The Stem tried to save him by flooding his body with biological energy—more than any human could contain. He became, essentially, a biological bomb."</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"When Harrens exploded deep within the Stem's core, the blast severed the organism. Earth's Stem was Earth's life support system. Its fracture initiated the planetary ecosystem collapse. The pollution, the climate change—those accelerated the death, but the Stem's destruction was the true cause."</span></p>

                        <p>Mikael felt the room spin. <span class="dialogue">"So Earth is dying because of an accident? And you moved the government to Mars because you found a replacement Stem here?"</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Exactly. We couldn't tell the public. Mass panic would have been catastrophic. Better to frame Mars colonization as human achievement than admission of our greatest failure."</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"But now,"</span> the director continued, <span class="dialogue">"we need you on Earth. We want to attempt something unprecedented—using your temporal mechanics research, we might be able to repair Earth's Stem by creating a stable temporal bridge. It's theoretical, dangerous, and might be impossible. But you're the only person brilliant enough to even attempt it."</span></p>

                        <p>Mikael looked at the broken Stem on the display. Then at his time machine schematics in his mind.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"When do I leave?"</span></p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Mikael arrived at Area 51 with his time machine and a head full of impossible theories. The facility sprawled beneath the Nevada desert—a massive underground complex built around the fractured Stem.</p>

                        <p>The exposed section was enormous, a pulsing organic structure that seemed to breathe even in its damaged state. Containment fields kept it stable, but Mikael could feel something emanating from it—a pull, almost magnetic, drawing him closer.</p>

                        <p>He worked for months, studying the Stem's quantum signature, trying to understand how his temporal mechanics might interface with its biological structure. The scientists briefed him on everything they'd learned: how the Stem was older than Earth's earliest life, how it had seeded the planet with the capacity for evolution, how every living thing was connected to it.</p>

                        <p>But Mikael noticed something in the research they hadn't mentioned: the Stem attracted certain individuals. People with specific neurological patterns. People whose brains perceived reality differently.</p>

                        <p>People like him, with his chronological disorder.</p>

                        <p>The pull grew stronger every day. Mikael felt it like gravity, the urge to approach, to touch, to <span class="emphasis">merge</span>. He resisted, knowing what happened to Harrens.</p>

                        <p>But one night, working late and alone, the attraction became overwhelming. Against every rational thought, every safety protocol, every warning—Mikael approached the exposed Stem, removed his protective gear, and placed his bare hand against its surface.</p>

                        <p>The world exploded into light and knowledge and time.</p>

                        <p>But unlike what happened to Harrens, unlike what should have happened, Mikael's chronological disorder—his unique neurology that couldn't perceive time linearly—allowed him to <span class="emphasis">survive</span> the energy transfer.</p>

                        <p>The Stem's energy didn't destroy him. It <span class="emphasis">merged</span> with him.</p>

                        <p>And in that moment of connection, Mikael saw something the Stem showed him. A choice. A path forward that was terrible and necessary.</p>

                        <p>When he pulled his hand away, purple energy crackled across his skin. The Stem had marked him. Changed him. Made him something more than human.</p>

                        <p>Alarms blared. Scientists rushed in, finding Mikael standing before the Stem, purple light emanating from his body.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Dr. Engel! Step away from—"</span></p>

                        <p>But Mikael was already running, the Stem's energy coursing through him, his mind full of terrible knowledge about what he had to do next.</p>

                        <p>He had to use the time machine. He had to create the paradox. He had to become Kaelim.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Mikael understood now. The dream hadn't been a warning to avoid the paradox. It had been preparation. The Stem had shown him his future because that future was <span class="emphasis">necessary</span>.</p>

                        <p>If he used the time machine and traveled back correctly—if he saved Georgia and Frieda properly—the timeline would stabilize in a way that prevented him from ever discovering the Stem's secrets, from ever gaining the power needed to face what was coming.</p>

                        <p>But if he made the "mistake," if he created the paradox and became Kaelim, infused with Stem energy and existing outside normal time—then he could position himself to make the ultimate sacrifice that would reset everything properly.</p>

                        <p>The Stem hadn't shown him the full plan. It couldn't. Time didn't work that way. But it had shown him enough: use the machine, accept the horror, become Kaelim, and eventually face a choice that would unmake the nightmare and birth something better.</p>

                        <p>Mikael returned to his quarters, the purple energy now contained within his body, invisible but present. He activated the time machine one final time.</p>

                        <p>He set the coordinates, deliberately choosing the wrong temporal range—the one he knew from his dream would take him too far back.</p>

                        <p>His hand hovered over the activation button.</p>

                        <p class="thought">Forgive me, Georgia. Forgive me, Mother. What I'm about to do will hurt more than anything imaginable. But it's the only way to save everyone.</p>

                        <p>He pressed the button.</p>

                        <p>Reality twisted.</p>

                        <p>And Mikael Engel stepped into his nightmare, knowing exactly what would happen, accepting it anyway.</p>

                        <p>The paradox began.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The timeline unfolded exactly as the dream had shown. Mikael arrived in the past, met young Georgia, fell in love, married her, and only realized on the day of the twins' birth that she was his mother.</p>

                        <p>He watched her die in childbirth, saw nurse Frieda take baby Mikael, saw baby Georgia sent to the orphanage.</p>

                        <p>But this time, he didn't run screaming in surprise. He ran in calculated horror, knowing this was necessary but unable to bear witnessing it.</p>

                        <p>He fled to the spaceport, the Stem energy inside him making him stronger, faster, more than human. He stole a spacecraft, gathered refugees and outcasts, and disappeared into the void.</p>

                        <p>Years passed. Decades. The purple energy kept him alive far beyond normal human lifespan. He built ships, established territories, became the figure from his dreams: <span class="emphasis">Kaelim, the Purple Tyrant</span>.</p>

                        <p>He recruited people, not through cruelty but through offering hope to the hopeless. He stole technology, not for conquest but to prepare for what he knew was coming. He built an empire not out of ambition but out of terrible necessity.</p>

                        <p>And he waited for the moment when his younger self would come to stop him.</p>

                        <p>Decades after becoming Kaelim, after the purple-armored legend had spread across the stars, Kaelim sat in his throne room and felt the temporal disturbance.</p>

                        <p>The younger Mikael had just woken from the dream. Had just realized Kaelim was his future self. And now, filled with rage at what he believed Kaelim had done—believing the paradox was a mistake rather than a plan—younger Mikael was coming.</p>

                        <p>Kaelim ordered his soldiers not to kill the intruder. <span class="dialogue">"Let him through. He needs to reach me."</span></p>

                        <p>His companion, Gaia—an alien telepath who'd joined him years ago after reading his mind and understanding his tragic purpose—stood beside him.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"He thinks you're the enemy,"</span> she said softly.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"I know. That's how it has to be."</span></p>

                        <p>Younger Mikael burst into the throne room, fury in his eyes. <span class="dialogue">"You ruined everything! You created this paradox, you made me my own father, you—"</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"I did it to save everyone,"</span> Kaelim said calmly. <span class="dialogue">"You'll understand one day."</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"I'll never understand becoming a monster!"</span></p>

                        <p>They fought. Kaelim defended but didn't truly attack, letting younger Mikael's rage drive him forward. He knew how this ended. He'd seen it.</p>

                        <p>Younger Mikael, in his fury, landed a killing blow.</p>

                        <p>As Kaelim fell, he smiled. <span class="dialogue">"Good,"</span> he whispered. <span class="dialogue">"Now it's complete."</span></p>

                        <p>Younger Mikael's body hit the floor, and reality fractured. The paradox was complete—Mikael had killed himself, creating an impossible causality loop.</p>

                        <p>And then Time itself arrived.</p>

                        <p>Time manifested as a presence filling the throne room, stopping everything. Kaelim's soldiers froze. Gaia's telepathic field went silent. Even Kaelim found he couldn't move.</p>

                        <p>A voice that was not a voice spoke:</p>

                        <p class="dialogue emphasis">THE PARADOX CANNOT SUSTAIN. I OFFER YOU A CHOICE.</p>

                        <p>Kaelim managed to speak. <span class="dialogue">"What choice?"</span></p>

                        <p class="dialogue emphasis">ALLOW THE RESET.</p>

                        <p>Kaelim closed his eyes. This was the moment the Stem had prepared him for. The choice that would unmake everything.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"What happens in the reset?"</span></p>

                        <p class="dialogue emphasis">A NEW TIMELINE. THE PARADOX NEVER OCCURS. YOU EXIST AS YOU WERE MEANT TO—A MAN WHO LOVED AND LOST BUT NEVER BROKE REALITY. A DIFFERENT PATH TO HEALING.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Will Georgia live? Will Frieda live?"</span></p>

                        <p class="dialogue emphasis">THEY WILL LIVE FULL LIVES. THE STEM WILL NOT BE BROKEN. EARTH WILL SURVIVE. YOU WILL HAVE A FAMILY, A GOOD LIFE.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"But I won't remember this?"</span></p>

                        <p class="dialogue emphasis">THE MEMORIES WILL BE BURIED. BUT NOT GONE.</p>

                        <p>Kaelim thought of Georgia, who he'd loved as a girlfriend, unknowingly married as his mother, lost twice over. He thought of Frieda, who'd raised him with love despite their complicated origins. He thought of all the pain, all the horror, all the decades as a tyrant trying to position pieces for this exact moment.</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Do it,"</span> he said. <span class="dialogue">"Reset everything. Give me the life I should have had."</span></p>

                        <p>Time spoke once more:</p>

                        <p class="dialogue emphasis">YOUR SACRIFICE BIRTHS A BETTER WORLD.</p>

                        <p>Reality inverted. The universe collapsed into a point of light.</p>

                        <p>And Kaelim felt himself unraveling, the purple armor fading, the Stem energy dissolving, his memories scattering like stars.</p>

                        <p>The last thought he had before everything went white:</p>

                        <p class="thought">Let them be happy. Let them all be happy.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Mikael Engel woke in his apartment, sunlight streaming through windows. He sat up, disoriented, with the feeling he'd been dreaming something profound that he couldn't quite remember.</p>

                        <p>He looked at the calendar on the wall. The date was clear, comprehensible. No temporal disorder. No confusion about when he was.</p>

                        <p>Fragments of impossible memories flitted through his mind. Purple armor. A woman dying in childbirth. A time machine. A choice offered by something vast and incomprehensible.</p>

                        <p>He shook his head. Strange dreams.</p>

                        <p>His phone rang. His sister Georgia. <span class="dialogue">"Hey, are you coming to Mom's birthday dinner tonight?"</span></p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Of course,"</span> Mikael said, smiling. <span class="dialogue">"I wouldn't miss it."</span></p>

                        <p>After hanging up, he looked around. Pictures on the wall showed a life well-lived: his wedding to Antonia. Their children. His mother Frieda, vibrant and healthy, retired from nursing. His sister Georgia, an environmental scientist—they'd worked together on projects that helped Earth's recovery.</p>

                        <p>The Stem cell therapy programs he'd helped develop as a biologist had accelerated environmental restoration. There'd been no catastrophic exodus to Mars, no Great Migration. Humanity had chosen to fix their planet.</p>

                        <p>It was a good life. A normal life.</p>

                        <p>So why did he feel such profound loss? Why did he look at calendars and feel a chill of recognition?</p>

                        <p>In his locked drawer was a journal. He opened it to the latest entry:</p>

                        <p class="thought">"The dreams persist. I see myself as someone else—someone called Kaelim. I see a woman named Georgia who isn't my sister. I see my mother dying. I see a time machine I built in a life I never lived.</p>

                        <p class="thought">What did I forget? And why do I feel grateful for forgetting it?"</p>

                        <p>Mikael closed the journal and looked out the window at the green Earth, the blue sky, the thriving world.</p>

                        <p>His phone buzzed. A notification from the research lab: "Dr. Engel, the temporal mechanics project has been approved for Phase 2. Congratulations on your breakthrough."</p>

                        <p>Mikael stared at the message for a long moment. Then he typed:</p>

                        <p><span class="dialogue">"Thank you, but I'm withdrawing from the project. Some discoveries are better left unmade."</span></p>

                        <p>He sent the message, deleted the project files, and never looked back.</p>

                        <p>Somewhere in the quantum foam between realities, a figure in purple armor smiled and faded into nonexistence.</p>

                        <p>The story of Mikael Engel came to an end.</p>

                        <p>Or perhaps, to a beginning.</p>
